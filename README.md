## Overview
The Enhanced DeepFake Detection Platform v3.0 is an advanced AI-powered solution designed to detect deepfake media content with high accuracy. This platform integrates cutting-edge neural network architectures, comprehensive face analysis, real-time stream monitoring, secure browsing capabilities, and an interactive analytics dashboard. It is built to assist users in verifying media authenticity and protecting against manipulated content.

## Features
- **Advanced Detection**: Utilizes a CNN-LSTM hybrid model with EfficientNet-B0 backbone for deepfake detection.
- **Multi-Method Analysis**: Includes 8 distinct face analysis methods (e.g., compression artifacts, blending artifacts, lighting consistency).
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Supports webcam and RTSP stream monitoring with alert and recording capabilities.
- **Secure Browsing**: Offers isolated browser sessions with risk assessment for safe content viewing.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Provides interactive visualizations and comprehensive reports on detection trends.
- **Authentication**: Features robust user authentication with optional TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) support.
- **Privacy Protection**: Implements data anonymization and secure storage of analysis results.
